# Near_Repeat_Calculator
Near repeat calculator is based on the postulate that “if a location is the target of a crime then homes within relatively short distance from the location have an increased chance of becoming a crime location within a limited number of weeks” (Ratcliffe & Rengert, 2008, p .58).
The method utilizes knox test for space-time clustering, which is based on Monte-Carlo simulations. As the method is computationally intensive for large datasets, we have developed a parallel version of near repeat calculator. 

Usage -- Run the near_repeat
